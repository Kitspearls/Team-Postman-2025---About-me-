OpenCart Test Plan Document.
Prepared for: Team Postman 
Prepared by: Adaobi Achilonu (Test Lead)
Date: 23 September 2025.

1. Introduction / Overview
This document defines the scope, approach, resources, schedule, and responsibilities for manual black-box testing of pre-selected OpenCart customer-facing features: Registration, Login, Change Password, and Cart flow.
Objective: To validate the functionality and usability of these features across Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers on Windows desktops.
Testing will be completed in four days, with daily scrums at 7:00 p.m. for progress tracking. 
Project Deliverables are:
Test Plan (this document)


Test Case document


Test Summary report


Bug Report



2. Assumptions
The test environment is stable and mirrors the production setup.


All required test data (sample products, user accounts) are already provisioned before execution.


No regression or smoke testing will be carried out due to time constraints.


Testers are familiar with OpenCart’s basic workflows.


No changes will be deployed during the 4-day test cycle.



3. Features to be Tested (Test Scope)
Registration 


Login 


Change password 


Cart flow 

4. Features Not to Be Tested (Out of scope)
Back-end admin features.


Third-party payment gateways 


Performance or load testing.


Accessibility compliance checks.



5. Approach
Test Method: Manual, black-box.


Techniques: Positive/negative functional testing, equivalence partitioning for inputs, and boundary checks for fields.


Execution: Scripted test cases complemented by exploratory testing.


Defect Logging: All issues will be captured in the Bug Report, including clear steps, screenshots (where applicable), expected vs. actual results, severity, and status.


Traceability matrix: Each test case is linked to feature coverage.



6. Pass / Fail Criteria
Pass: Expected behaviour observed, no defect raised.


Fail: Actual behaviour deviates from expected, logged as a defect.


Exit Criteria: All critical test cases executed, all high/critical defects logged and reported.



7. Test Deliverables
Test Plan document (this document).


Test Case document (detailing preconditions, steps, test data, expected result).


Test Summary report (execution status, coverage, defect metrics).


Bug Report (defect list with IDs and severity).

9. Test Environment
OS: Windows 10 & Windows 11 desktops.


Browsers: Google Chrome (latest + previous), Mozilla Firefox (latest + previous).


OpenCart Version: Stable version deployed on staging.


Tools: Screenshot capture (mono snap), shared defect tracker (Google Sheet), documentation (Google Doc), Dummy account generator (Mailinator), network provider (MTN & Airtel)


Test Data: Dummy user accounts, products, coupons, clean test database snapshot for reproducible runs



10. Schedule of Tasks & Milestones
Project window: 4 days (Mon 22 Sep – Fri 26 Sep 2025)
Daily scrum at 7 pm to review progress, blockers, and defect status

Date
Activity
23 Sep
Test case finalization, environment readiness
24 Sep
Execute Registration & Login cases, log defects
25 Sep
Execute Change Password & Cart/Checkout cases, log defects
26 Sep
Consolidate Bug Report, prepare Test Summary, submit deliverables



11. Risks
Tight timeframe (4 days): May limit exhaustion of potential test cases. → Mitigation: Prioritize critical path test cases.


Environment instability: Like Network failure due to server crash or climate changes, could block execution. → Mitigation: Ensure a backup test environment is in place.


Browser differences: Unexpected behaviour between Chrome/Firefox. → Mitigation: Assign testers per browser to ensure coverage.

12. Approvals
Test Plan reviewed by: Mr Bukola (QA Lead)
